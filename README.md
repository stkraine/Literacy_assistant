# Literacy_assistant

To run Literacy Assistant Pro, run main.py in any Python environment with PySimpleGui, pyaudio, websockets, asyncio, and pyglet. 

A user interface will display, with a prompt to read. Click the "Record" button, and read the words (or don't!) to experiment with AssemblyAI's speech recognition tool.
When a word is detected to be incorrect, the incorrect word will be shown on a flashcard until the user pronounces it correctly.
